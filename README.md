# cRYpToGRaphY
###### The art or science encompassing the principles and methods of transforming an intelligible message into one that is unintelligible, and then re-transforming that message back to its original form.

**Plaintext** The original intelligible message.

**Cipher text** The transformed message Cipher An algorithm for transforming an intelligible message into one that is unintelligible by transposition and/or substitution methods.

**Key** Some critical information used by the cipher, known only to the sender& receiver.

**Encipher** *(encode)* The process of converting plaintext to cipher text using a cipher and a key.

**Decipher** *(decode)* the process of converting cipher text back into plaintext using a cipher and a key.

**Cryptanalysis** The study of principles and methods of transforming an unintelligible message back into an intelligible message without knowledge of the key. Also called code breaking.

**Cryptology** Both cryptography and cryptanalysis.

**Code** An algorithm for transforming an intelligible message into an unintelligible one using a code-book Cryptograph.
